      detailedDescription: `This project was carried out at Genvia, a joint venture of CEA, SLB, Vinci, Vicat, and the Occitanie Region, to revolutionize the manufacturing and maintenance of hydrogen electrolyzers.
    
    On the traceability side, I automated the creation of Manufacturing Orders (MOs) by transforming legacy Excel files into structured JSON records using Python scripts. This digitalized the entire stack and substack manufacturing process, setting up a knowledge graph-friendly system that enables granular tracking down to individual layers. The work dramatically reduced manual data entry efforts, saving hundreds of hours and paving the way for advanced analytics.
    
    On the durability side, I developed a predictive maintenance pipeline to forecast failures in electrolyzer layers, aiming to replace costly 3000-hour endurance tests. This involved preprocessing noisy voltage signals, generating 2D representations using Gramian Angular Fields (GADF) and Markov Transition Fields (MTF), then training a modified Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with CNN encoders. The approach combined supervised learning on historical failures with unsupervised reconstruction loss and domain adaptation to handle lab shifts, achieving 91% anomaly detection accuracy and influencing Genviaâ€™s predictive maintenance strategy.`,
